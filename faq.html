	<h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
	<ul>
	<li>Q1: Does vaccination cause autism? A1: <span class="emphasis">NO!</span>Vaccinations have no relationship to autism</li>
	<li>Q2: Why do people with autism have a strict diet? A2: People on the spectrum have unusual responses to smells, textures, tastes and appearances. What seems fine to a person not on the spectrum could disgust people on the spectrum.</li>
	<li>Q3: Why does my child on the spectrum not understand that I'm being sarcastic with them? A3: They likely are unable to understand the context and believe that you're telling the truth. Try explaining what you actually mean, and they should be able to understand.</li>
	<li>Q4: My child occasionally flicks his fingers when stressed. Is that normal? A4: Yes! That is normal. This, among other repetitive actions are known as stimming. If they start to stim, please ask them if they are stressed, and if so, what you can do to help.</li>
	<li>Q5: I told my child that they have a doctor's appointment the following day, and they got upset. Why did they do this? A5: The doctor's appointment is a change in their routine, and people on the spectrum like their routines. My advice for the future is that when doctor's appointments get made, try to let your child know at least a week in advance.</li>
	<li>Q6: I am a teacher, and one of my students on the spectrum hates the fire alarm whenever it goes off. What does this mean? A6: Oh hi! There can be two reasons: The first is that the alarm represents an unexpected change in routine for the school day, and the second is the loud noise that the alarm makes. Hope this helps, and keep up the good work!</li>
	<li>Q7: My child expresses that they feel no pain. Is this normal? A7: People on the spectrum have different sensory reactions, and this includes an indifference to pain. What feels like agony to someone not on the spectrum can merely feel uncomfortable to people on the spectrum.</li>
	<li>Q8: Why does my child not speak, and can they understand us? A8: They may have delayed language skills and yes, they can understand you. Try getting multiple sets of blocks with the alphabet and tell them to spell out words, and they will most likely do so! </li>
	<li>Q9: My child does not like it when we move furniture. Why do they not like it? A9: This is known as sameness, or resistance to change. Next time, try explaining why you are moving something.</li>
	<li>Q10: My child on the spectrum can easily understand how two or more things are related and yet fails to understand how sentences link up. Is this normal? A10: Yes! People on the spectrum can show strong abilities in an area while having much weaker abilities in others!</li>
	<li>Q11: My child refuses to listen to me. Is this normal? A11: Yes. This is pathological demand avoidance. Try letting them make their own decisions on what they want to do unless you really need them to do something.</li>
	<li>Q12: My child has difficulty keeping conversations on any topic other than what it started as. Why do they do that? A12: This is known as monotropism and can best be compared to tunnel vision. Try having them interact with more people.</li>
	<li>Q13: My child repeats words I say to them. Why? A13: This is echolalia. This may be a coping mechanism to allow them to contribute to a conversation when unable to produce spontaneous speech.</li>
	<li>Q14: My child has trouble regulating their volume in different settings. Why does this occur? A14: They do not recognize that they need to control the volume of their voice in different social settings. This is normal, so try simulating different environments at home and teach your child how to moderate their voice.</li>
	<li>Q15: My child occasionally bites their fingernails off. Why does this occur? A15: This likely happens due to them wanting to modulate pain perception. Start asking your child how severe their pain is on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being negligible and 10 meaning severe pain.</li>
