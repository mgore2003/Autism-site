		<h1>What is Autism?</h1>
		<p>Autism, formally called either autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autism spectrum condition (ASC), is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction, and repetitive or restricted patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities, which can include hyper- and hyporeactivity to sensory input. The fact that autism is a spectrum disorder means that autism can manifest very differently in each person. As such, what helps for one person with autism may not help another person with autism.</p>
		<h1>Samples of Symptoms of Autism</h1>
		<ul>
		<li id="routine">Desire for Routine: People on the spectrum will usually desire for a routine that they will follow daily.</li>
		<li id="resistance">Resistance to Change: The routine will be followed, and people on the spectrum <span class="emphasis">will resist change by any means necessary.</span></li>
		<li id="language">Delayed Language Skills: People on the spectrum will usually have delayed language skills, and this symptoms' manifestations can be but are not limited to having a smaller vocabulary than peers or difficulty of expressing themselves verbally.</li>
		<li id="non-verbal">Difficulties with Non-Verbal Communication: People on the spectrum have difficulties with non-verbal communication. This manifests as but not limited to: making infrequent eye contact, struggling with both production and recognization of facial expressions and what they mean for the conversation, and trouble recognizing subtle expressions of emotion.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Symbols of Autism</h1>
		<p>There are three main symbols for autism. The first symbol is an rainbow infinity symbol, which will be shown below. The rainbow infinity symbol is self-explanatory: an infinity symbol colored in the style of a rainbow gradient.</p>

		<p>The second symbol of autism is the autistic pride flag. This also has an infinity symbol, but it is not rainbow colored, rather, it is white. The colors of the flag are as follows: red at the top of the flag, orange above the symbol, white for the infinity symbol and yellow around it, light-green below the symbol, and a medium-green at the bottom of the flag. <p>

		<p>The third and final symbol is the puzzle piece ribbon. This is a ribbon with the design of multicolored puzzle pieces adorning it, with the pieces having red, yellow, light-blue, or medium-blue colors.</p>
